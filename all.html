        Shiva is known as The Destroyer within the Trimurti,
         the Hindu trinity which also includes Brahma and Vishnu.
         In the Shaivite tradition, Shiva is the Supreme Lord who creates, protects and transforms the universe.
         In the goddess-oriented Shakta tradition, the Supreme Goddess (Devi) is regarded as the energy and creative power (Shakti) 
         and the equal complementary partner of Shiva.
          Shiva is one of the five equivalent deities in Panchayatana puja of the Smarta tradition of Hinduism.
Shiva has many aspects, benevolent as well as fearsome.
Shiva is also known as Adiyogi (the first Yogi), regarded as the patron god of yoga, meditation and the arts.
